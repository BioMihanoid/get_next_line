# Get_next_line
Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious

## Description
This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor.

## Project goals

1. Learn work with file descriptor
2. Eliminate all leaks
3. Find out what static variables are and how to use them

## How to compile/to run

You open console in Linux/MacOS and enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/BioMihanoid/get_next_line
cd get_next_line
make
```

P.S. After compilation, you can use this function to read lines in a file by a specific file descriptor.
